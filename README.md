# Data Structures Implementations in Java

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in Java. These implementations are created from scratch, showcasing the underlying principles and operations for each data structure. The current set of implementations includes:

* Arrays
* Singly Linked Lists
* Doubly Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues

## Overview

Each data structure is implemented as a separate class, focusing on clarity and educational value. The implementations are designed to be as simple and understandable as possible, making them suitable for learning and as a base for further development.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
* File: `Array.java`
* Description: A dynamic array implementation that supports basic operations like insertion, deletion, and resizing.

### Singly Linked Lists
* File: `SinglyLinkedList.java`
* Description: A simple linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Supports operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Doubly Linked Lists
* File: `DoublyLinkedList.java`
* Description: A linked list where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes. Supports more efficient bidirectional traversal.

### Stacks
* File: `Stack.java`
* Description: A stack (LIFO) implementation using either arrays or linked lists. Supports push, pop, and peek operations.

### Queues
* File: `Queue.java`
* Description: A queue (FIFO) implementation using either arrays or linked lists. Supports enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
  
## Usage
To use these data structures in your project, you can simply clone the repository and include the necessary files in your Java project.
```
#bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structure-implementations.git
```
Each class can be tested with a simple main method or integrated into a larger project. The code is designed to be self-contained and easy to extend.
